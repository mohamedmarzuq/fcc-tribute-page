# FCC-Tribute-Page
 This is a project/assignment submitted for the FreeCodeCamp "responsive web design" course. 
 
 The assignment was to build a Tribute Page. So I thought I'm already going to make one, then it's the best chance to build one for my hard core fan, "Tim Cook" :). Also I think none of the people haven't created one for Tim Cook. The reason they haven't created is we mainly make tribute pages for people who died but I think many of the people are making tribute videos for their fan's birthday then I can also make one for my dear Tim Cook 
 
 The fonts, theme and layouts are mainly inspired from https://apple.com. If you want to see the live page, click this -> https://mohamedmarzuq.github.io/fcc-tribute-page/.
