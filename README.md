# FCC-Tribute-Page
 This is a project/assignment submitted for the FreeCodeCamp "responsive web design" course. The assignment was to build a Tribute Page. So I thought I'm already going to make one, then it's the best chance to make one for my hard core fan called "Tim Cook" :).
 
 The fonts, theme and layouts are mainly inspired from https://apple.com/. If you want to see the live page, click this -> https://mohamedmarzuq.github.io/fcc-tribute-page/.
