# FCC-Tribute-Page
 This is a project/assignment submitted for the FreeCodeCamp "responsive web design" course. 
 
 The assignment was to build a Tribute Page. So I thought I'm already going to make one, then it's the best chance to build one for my hard core fan🥰, "Tim Cook". 
 
 The fonts and theme are mainly inspired from https://apple.com also my friends [@sohail21400](https://github.com/sohail21400) and [@RayyanRNKJ](https://github.com/rayyanrnkj) has helped me a lot for UI designing, content writing. Thankyou so much Rayyan and Sohail uncle🙏.
